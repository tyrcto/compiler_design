Scanner changes:
- Writes source code to .jasm file as comments.
- Comments in the source code are altered (comment tags are remove, because javaa.exe can only receive C-like comments)

Parser changes:
- Code generator used to generate Java Assembly code
- Code generator has a flag to output more details about the code generated (to turn this feature on, change [flag] in codegenerator.cc to true)
- Label controller used to control the labels of loops/conditionals
- Symbol table entries have extra variables so the code generator is able to generate the code properly
- funVarCount global variable used to keep track of amount of variables in the function scope 
- Symbol table have new functions:
    - isGlobal = check if given ID is a global variable
    - Lable related functions = modify LabelController from SymbolTableList
